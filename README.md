# Bad apple 
Bad apple played using individual frames as wallpaper

#### Works only on windows [tested using windows 11]

###  ⚠️ Setting each frame as a wallpaper makes this process very slow!!

# How to use

Step 1. Have "Bad apple!!" downloaded (will also work with any video of your choice)

Step 2. Run main.py and type the path to your video

Step 3. Wait for it to finish and it will start playing
